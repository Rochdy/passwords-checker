## Short Intoduction
- This Repo includes:
  - [Task#1] An API to check the validity of a password
  - [Task#2 & Task#3] A script that:
    - Uses the api in Task#1 to check the validity of a set of password and change the valid status in DB
    - Uses `erasys/compromised-pw-api` to check and print if the password has been compromised

- This app contains 2 components (API & Script), it uses docker-compose file to setup the 4 needed services: [ `api` , `password_checker_script` , `mysql` , `erasys/compromised-pw-api` ]. Check `docker-compose.yml` & `src/components`
- The provided passwords dump is places in `docker/mysql/init` and it's mapped with 
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` so it can be imported

- I tried to keep the app as minimal as possible, so i only used:
  - `express` for routing
  - `prisma` to deal with db
  - `tiny-json-http` to deal with http requests
  - `eslint` for linting

## Setup with docker
This project is using docker & docker compose, so simply you can get everything up and running locally by running:
- `docker-compose up`: that will build all the 4 services [ `api` , `password_checker_script` , `mysql` , `erasys/compromised-pw-api` ]
- After that you can:
  - Check the API via `http://localhost:3000/`

  - Run the script via `docker-compose exec password_checker_script npm run password:script` [the sql dump is already imported, so every thing should run fine ðŸ‘€]
